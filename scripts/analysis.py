        "Pageviews": "Identify pages with high traffic and optimize them for conversions. If certain pages are underperforming, consider improving content or SEO. Pages with low pageviews may require better internal linking or promotional strategies.",

        "Total Followers Growth": "A steady increase in followers indicates successful engagement strategies. Review which campaigns or content drove growth to replicate successful tactics. Conversely, if growth is plateauing, consider new channels or collaborations to engage your audience.",
        "Engagement Rate (Likes, Comments, Shares)": "High engagement suggests that your audience finds your content valuable. Focus on content formats that yield the highest engagement rates, and continue experimenting with new formats or themes. Low engagement may require revisiting your content strategy.",

        "Organic Traffic Growth": "If organic traffic is growing consistently, consider investing in additional SEO efforts or content marketing. If traffic is stagnant, conduct a competitive analysis, refresh existing content, or pursue backlinking opportunities.",
        "Keyword Ranking Changes": "Focus on keywords that are improving while analyzing those that are declining. Consider developing content around high-potential keywords and revisiting SEO tactics for keywords that are losing ranking.",

        "Cost Per Click (CPC)": "Analyze your CPC by campaign. If you find campaigns with increasing CPC without a corresponding rise in conversions, rethink those campaigns. Consider reallocating budget to campaigns with a better ROI.",
        "Conversion Rate": "Track conversion rates closely. High conversion campaigns should receive additional funding. If conversions are below expectations, analyze the user funnel, landing pages, and offer to find potential drop-off points.",
        "Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)": "Campaigns with a high ROAS should be scaled. Conversely, campaigns with low ROAS may need to be refined or cut entirely. Understanding the channels contributing to high ROAS can inform future investments.",

        "Average Order Value (AOV)": "If AOV is increasing, analyze which products are driving this. Strategies to enhance AOV include cross-selling, upselling, and bundling products. If AOV is declining, consider revising pricing, product quality, or promotional strategies."
